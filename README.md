# Analyse-AB-test-results
Udacity Data Analyst nano degree project to analyse the AB test results of a E-commerce website.

Pre-requisites:
Anaconda Installation for running .ipynb notebooks.

Getting Started:
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. In this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to explore the data statistically and help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files we need to complete the project are uploaded.
